### Dana is a reporter writing a story and building an accompanying website about UFO sightings around the world.  She has obtained extensive data on UFO sighting around the world that will be available on the website.  To enable readers to select sightings of interest to them, Dana would like to include the ability to filter by multiple aspects of each UFO sighting specifically when (date) and where (city, state, country) the sighting occurred, as well as reported details (shape) about the UFO.

### The technologies used in building the website include:
###       JavaScript ES 6+, for providing dynamic options to a website (like filtering)
###       HTML, to create the web pages
###       Bootstrap, for arranging and formatting items on the website
###       CSS, for formatting the website
 
### One recommendation for further development of the website is to create filters that are not case-sensitive.  Another recommendation is to apply techniques to clean and format the data for output.
